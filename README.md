# PixFooty_Game
PixFooty is a real-time, embedded 2D football game developed in C++ and deployed on an STM32 NUCLEO microcontroller board. The game uses digital hardware inputs to control player movement and game mechanics without an operating system, demonstrating low-level embedded programming and interrupt-driven control.
