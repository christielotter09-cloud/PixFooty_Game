# ðŸŽ® PixFooty â€“ Embedded 2D Football Game on Microcontroller

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
**PixFooty** is a real-time 2D football (soccer) game implemented in **C++** and designed to run on an **embedded microcontroller platform**. The game simulates a football match between a human player and a CPU-controlled opponent, using low-level hardware interaction for user input, display output, and timing control.

This project was developed as part of an embedded systems and real-time programming module, showcasing skills in **object-oriented programming**, **microcontroller interfacing**, **game engine logic**, and **AI decision-making** in constrained hardware environments.

## ðŸ§  Game Architecture
PixFooty is structured using **modular C++ classes**, each representing a critical component of the game engine:

| File               | Purpose |
|--------------------|---------|
| `Player.cpp` / `Player.h` | Handles player movement, control logic, and interactions |
| `Dec.cpp` / `Dec.h` | CPU opponent AI (decision engine) â€“ calculates automated movements and responses |
| `Ball.cpp` / `Ball.h` | Physics and movement of the football object |
| `Joystick.cpp` / `Joystick.h` | Reads real-time input from joystick or buttons and maps it to game actions |
| `Map.cpp` / `Map.h` | Responsible for rendering the game field and boundary logic |
| `PixFootyEngine.cpp` / `PixFootyEngine.h` | Main game engine â€“ manages game states, collision detection, scoring, and timing |
| `Utils.h` | Helper functions used across modules |
